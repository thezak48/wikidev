## Lidarr图书馆
---
The library page is where are all your artists are listed, as well as the progress (number of tracks available/unavailable). It is here where you can filter your library, and even create customer filters. You can also select individual artists to view tracks (available or missing) and albums, as well make edits to their search profile, monitoring, paths, and anything you can do via the "Add New" tab. It is the landing page and practical heart of Lidarr.

图书馆页面是列出所有艺术家以及进度（可用/不可用曲目数量）的地方。在这里，您可以对图书馆进行筛选，甚至创建自定义筛选器。您还可以选择单个艺术家来查看曲目（可用或缺失）和专辑，并对其搜索配置文件、监控、路径以及通过“添加新”选项卡可以进行的任何编辑。这是Lidarr的主页和实用核心。
